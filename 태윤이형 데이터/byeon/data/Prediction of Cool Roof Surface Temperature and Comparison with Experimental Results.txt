Only a few experimental results for the cool roof are available in Korea. Moreover predictions based
on theoretical analysis are lacking as well. The purpose of this study is to predict the cool roof surface
temperatures, and then to compare those predictive values with experimental results. The parameters are
insolation, wind, surface emission and absorption of irradiation from the sky, and air temperature. The colors of
the roof are related with radiative properties such as SR (Solar reflectivity) and TE(Total Emissivity). KMA
(Korea Meteorological Administration) data is used to simulate the roof surface temperature. The roof surface
temperature decreases with increasing SR and TE, decreasing sky temperature, and decreasing air temperature
over the roof. For hot roof, increasing convection to adjacent air decreases the roof surface temperature, but the
opposite is true for the cold roof. The analytic predictions match relatively well with experimental results even
with KMA hourly data. More experimental results with conditions specified are needed to justify the analytic
model further.
