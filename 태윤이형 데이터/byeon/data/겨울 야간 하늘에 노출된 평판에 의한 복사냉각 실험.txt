The radiant cooling (RC) effects are studied during the winter night. The plate was viewing the nighttime sky. The data were collected at the rooftop of the Engineering building at the Dongguk University in Seoul, Korea. As observed during the summer night, the plate temperature was lower than ambient temperature under the RC favorable conditions. The parameters under study are the wind velocity, cloud index, and visibility for given system size and surface condition. The results follow the same tendency with these parameters as observed from the previous study for the summer night. As long as the wind velocity is less than around 2 m/s, the radiant cooling was observed with the system under study. In some cases, the radiant cooling temperature differences (RCTD) are higher than those for the summer night. The larger the RCTD as the wind velocity decreases and as the sky becomes clear.
