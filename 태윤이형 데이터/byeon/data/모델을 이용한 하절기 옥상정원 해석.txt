The purpose of this paper is to study the effectiveness of a green roof by simple mathematical
model. The developed model simulates a green roof during the summer. The results explain and
support the claims in the literature such that effectiveness of a green roof depends on the climate
condition, and on the insulation condition of the roof. If insolation can not be reduced more than
60% by the shading effects of a green roof, more active measures than green roof seem
necessary. The analysis tools like presented in the paper is necessary especially to consider
climate effect, to design, and also to test green roof.
