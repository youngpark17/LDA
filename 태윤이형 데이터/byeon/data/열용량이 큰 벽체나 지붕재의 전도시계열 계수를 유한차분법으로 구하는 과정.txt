The purpose of this paper is to apply the numerical solution procedure to compute conduction
time series factors (CTSF) for construction materials with large thermal capacities. After
modifying the procedure in Ref. [9], it is applied to find the CTSF for the wall type 19 and the
roof type 18 of ASHRAE. The response periods for one hr pulse load are longer than 24hrs for
these wall and roof. The CTSF generated using modified procedure agree well with the values
presented in the ASHRAE handbook. The modified procedure is a general procedure that can be
applied to find CTSF for materials with complex structures. For the large thermal capacity
materials, it should be checked whether thermal response period of the material is over 24hr or
not. With suggested solution procedure, it is easy to check the validity of the CTSF based on
24hr period.
