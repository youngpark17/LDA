The purpose of this paper is to propose the way of computing conduction time series factors
(CTSF) using numerical method. After the accuracy of the numerical solution procedure being
verified, the method is applied to the wall type 24 and roof type 14 of ASHARE to find the
conduction time series coefficients, so called conduction time series factors. The results agree
well with the values presented in the ASHRAE handbook. The method proposed can be easily
applied to find unknown CTSF for more complex structures. It provides information about the
temperature changes at a given location and time, thus validity of generated CTSF can be
checked easily.
