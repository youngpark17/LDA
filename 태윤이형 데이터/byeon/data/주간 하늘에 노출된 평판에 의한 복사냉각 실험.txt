The purpose of this study is to check whether the plate temperature could be lower than the surrounding air by using the radiant cooling during the day time in summer at Seoul. Without an insolation shield as this experiment was performed, a few cases were found. The temperatures of the black painted plate are lower than those of the aluminium film coated plate if the following condition exist; no or small insolation over the plate, the wind velocity less than around 2 m/s, and clear sky. However if there are insolation over the plate, the temperatures of the aluminium coated plate are lower than the black painted plate. Also, as the wind velocity increases, the plate temperature decreases faster. The temperature response of the small system is much faster than the large system.
