 The purpose of this study is to predict thermal performance of experimental models for the cool roof during the summer
in Korea. According to literature survey, there is a few experimental results for cool roofs in Korea. Moreover theoretical prediction
ons are lacking. Unsteady systems for the roof and the air inside the box are modeled and solved using numerical method.
The predictions match well with experimental results for roof surface temperature. Predictions for room air temperatures are
about the same as those amplitudes of experiments but phase shift of time are observed. The simulation results deviate most
for ceiling surface temperature. The ceiling and room temperatures depend more on thermal properties that assumed because
of lacking information. The results are more sensitive to solar reflectivity and total emissivity than other variables. For clear
night and day, the results are sensitive to irradiation from the sky.
