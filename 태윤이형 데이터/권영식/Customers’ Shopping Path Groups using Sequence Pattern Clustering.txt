In this paper, we present a study of sequence pattern clustering approach for customersâ€™ shopping path groups on
actual grocery store data recorded using RFID technology. The approach is performed using K-medoids
clustering that is able to group shopping path based on its sequence pattern. A method for selecting the best
cluster number based on sequence pattern similarity that is measured using LCSS (Longest Common
Subsequence Similarity) is proposed. And the experimental results show the proposed approach performs well
compared to the traditional approach.
