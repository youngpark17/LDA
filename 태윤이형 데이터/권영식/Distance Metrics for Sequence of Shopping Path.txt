The shopping path analysis has been very important in order to understand the
customer behavior in the groceries. Shopping path can be considered to be a sequence data.
Given a set of sequences, the distance between pairs of shopping paths reflects how close the
customer shopping paths are in a store. By the distance, we can group the similar shopping
patterns. In this research, we perform the k-means clustering and compare the performance
of several distance metrics, including operation distance which we proposed in our previous
research. Experimental results show our proposed distance measure performs best in light
precision.
Keywords: sequence distance metric, shopping path.
