Identifying the major moving patterns of shoppersʼ movements in the selling floor has been a longstanding issue in the retailing industry. With the advent of RFID technology, it has been easier to collect
the moving data for a individual shopperʼs movement. Most of the previous studies used the traditional
clustering technique to identify the major moving pattern of customers. However, in using clustering
technique, due to the spatial constraint (aisle layout or other physical obstructions in the store), standard
clustering methods are not feasible for moving data like shopping path should be adjusted for the analysis
in advance, which is time-consuming and causes data distortion. To alleviate this problems, we propose a
new approach to spatial pattern clustering based on longest common subsequence (LCSS). Experimental
results using the real data obtained from a grocery in Seoul show that the proposed method performs well
in finding the hot spot and dead spot as well as in finding the major path patterns of customer movements.
