In these day, many data including sensor, delivery, credit and stock data are generated
continuously in massive quantity. It is difficult to learn from these data because they are large in
volume and changing fast in their concepts. To handle these problems, learning methods based in
sliding window methods over time have been used. But these approaches have a problem of rebuilding
models every time new data arrive, which requires a lot of time and cost. Therefore we need very
simple incremental learning methods. Bayesian method is an example of these methods but it has a
disadvantage which it requries the prior knowledge(probabiltiy) of data.
In this study, we propose a learning method based on attribute values. In the proposed method, even
though we don't know the prior knowledge(probability) of data, we can apply our new method to data.
The main concept of this method is that each attribute value is regarded as an expert learner,
summing up the expert learners lead to better results. Experimental results show our learning method
learns from data very fast and performs well when compared to current learning methods(decision tree
and bayesian).
