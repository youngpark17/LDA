One of the problems in developing a collaborative recommendation system is the scalability. To alleviate
the scalability problem efficiently, enhancing the performance of the recommendation system, we propose
a new recommendation system using feature selection. In our experiments, the proposed system using
about a third of all features shows the comparable performances when compared with using all features in
light of precision, recall and number of computations, as the number of users and products increases.
