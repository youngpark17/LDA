With the increasing proliferation of World Wide Web, electronic mail systems have become very widely used
communication tools. Researches on e-mail classification have been very important in that e-mail classification
system is a major engine for e-mail response management systems which mine unstructured e-mail messages
and automatically categorize them.
 In this research we compare the performance of Naive Bayesian learning and Centroid-Based Classification
using the different data set of an on-line shopping mall and a credit card company. We analyze which method
performs better under which conditions. We compared classification accuracy of them which depends on
structure and size of train set and increasing numbers of class.
 The experimental results indicate that Naive Bayesian learning performs better, while Centroid-Based
Classification is more robust in terms of classification accuracy.
Keywords: classification, text mining, naive bayesian classifier, centroid-based classifier
