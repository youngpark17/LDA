Growth curves including Logistic and Gompertz
functions are widely used in forecasting the
market demand. To estimate the parameters of
those functions, we use the non-linear least square
method. However, it is difficult to set up the
starting points for each parameter. If a wrong
starting point is selected, the result reveals the
local optimum or does not converge to a certain
value.
The purpose of this paper is to resolve the
problem of selecting a starting point. Especially,
rescaling the market data using the national
economic index make it possible to figure out the
range of parameters and to utilize the grid search
method. Applications to some real data are also
included
