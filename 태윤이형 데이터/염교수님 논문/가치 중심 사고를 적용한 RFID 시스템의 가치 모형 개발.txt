Recently, more and more firms are considering the adoption of RFID technology because it is expected to
make process automation easier and has many different application areas. A review of existing studies
about RFID adoption methodology shows that the most of the proposed methodologies are mainly based
on economic evaluations. However, in the near future when the adoption and diffusion of RFID become
major forces among business firms, it would surely have some limits to decide its adoption solely on the
basis of economic considerations. In order for all the important strategic objectives to be considered during
the major decision processes, it is necessary to make explicit what the decision makers really want to
achieve from the RFID system. In this paper, we propose a general value model of RFID system which can
provide an overall vision of all values RFID adoption may offer and a way to search and evaluate
alternatives on the basis of these values. Especially, this model contains not only opportunities but also
risks of RFID adoption so that a balanced consideration can be made. The model building process was
essentially based on the ‘value-focused thinking’ approach proposed by R. Keeney. The proposed model is
expected to provide insights about what to do in the process of introduction in order to maximize the
potential benefits and minimize the negative risks. Referring to this value model, the important decisions
would have greater chance to be based on a balanced consideration of opportunities and risks.
