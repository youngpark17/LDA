A growing number of organizations are considering the adoption of new technologies to enhance their
competitiveness. The new projects related with RFID technology are some typical examples: the companies
planning to carry out those projects hope that the introduction of new technology into their organization
would remedy all their current inefficiencies and eventually bring them considerable economic benefits.
However, such successful results would not be obtained if the complicated problems related with S/W and
H/W developments, complex team structure or the migration with barcode and etc. are not resolved
satisfactorily during the project.
In this paper, some potential barriers to successful introduction of new technology, especially that of RFID,
are identified and classified into three categories according to the phases of introduction process, i.e.,
investigation, implementation and application phases. The results of a survey regarding the importance of
each barrier, the respondents of which are active developers or consultants of RFID technology, are also given.
