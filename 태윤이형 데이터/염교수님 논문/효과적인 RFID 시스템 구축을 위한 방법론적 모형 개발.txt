With development of RFID technology, medicine and national defense as well as logistics and distribution
industries have tried to adopt RFID system. Small projects as well as large national projects have planned to
adopt the new technology. However, a lot of companies that have promoted a RFID-based project have
confronted many problems due to a lack of information about demonstration projects and absence of systematic
guideline. Therefore, it's urgent to develop a practical and useful guideline for companies that have considered to
adopt the RFID system.
In this paper, a practical framework to adopt RFID system is suggested by five phases : establishment of project
plan, analysis of objectives, selection of equipments, development/installation, and operation/post management
phases. Besides, a detail method by each stages is also given. A systematic RFID system adoption procedure has
been defined through an analysis on demonstrated projects and interview with an expert and the adoption
method by stage has been suggested. The purpose of this paper is to minimize the entry barriers by suggesting a
practical RFID adoption procedure.
